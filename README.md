    # Crystal Collector

# Getting Started
This is my Crystal Collector game that I have constructed. The rules of the game are as follows: The player is given a random number at the start of the game. This is Thanos' number. There are four Infinity Stones to choose from, each stone has a random value that will add to the player's score. The player wins if they match their score with Thanos' score. If the player's score goes over Thanos' number, they lose. Thanos' number will change at random each game, as will the values of each Infinity Stone. Yet, the wins and losses will be tallied. Can you beat Thanos at his own game?

Whomever needs to see my code just needs a Visual Source Code program, along with an understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
